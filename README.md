# Math19B-Project

This is a checkpointed Jupyter Notebook (Python) that contains the code used for the single cell analysis in our paper.

The script and the outputs of each section should be viewable when clicked in GitHub (there is no need to run the script locall unless desired) in the 'Math19B Project.ipynb' file.

Note: the actual data used is too large to put in the Github repository, I will send it in an email if requested. However, it is also available freely at https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/6.0.0/SC3_v3_NextGem_DI_Neurons_5K_SC3_v3_NextGem_DI_Neurons_5K
The data you want is contained within the Feature/cell matrix download. The file is within the zipped directory as 'matrix.mtx'

Code is structuted following the tutorial from  https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html
